TrackStar is an open-source game inspired by Hitster, where players guess the release year of songs to build a chronological timeline. 🎶

## Key Features 🚀

*   **Gameplay:** Guess the release year of songs and create a chronological timeline.
*   **Open-Source:**  Contribute to the project and help expand its features.
*   **Custom Datasets:** Create your own song datasets using the provided `generate.py` backend script.
*   **Apple Music Integration:** Play the songs using Apple Music.
*   **Hitster cards support:** Choose between your own printed cards or use the original Hitster card set.

## Creating Custom Datasets

TrackStar allows you to use custom song datasets. A Python script, `generate.py` in the `backend` directory, is provided to help you generate these datasets.

If you've created a custom dataset that you think would be valuable for other players, consider contributing it to the official repository:

- Create a pull request with:
   - A clear description of your dataset (genre, time period, theme etc.)
   - Any special notes about the dataset
