TrackStar is an open-source game inspired by Hitster, where players guess the release year of songs to build a chronological timeline. üé∂

## About

This project aims to recreate the fun and engaging gameplay of Hitster in a digital, open-source format. It's built with Swift and designed to be easily extensible and customizable. Players can even create their own custom song datasets to personalize their gaming experience.

## Key Features üöÄ

*   **Hitster-inspired Gameplay:** Guess the release year of songs and create a chronological timeline.
*   **Open-Source:**  Contribute to the project and help expand its features.
*   **Custom Datasets:** Create your own song datasets using the provided `generate.py` backend script.  This allows you to tailor the game to specific genres, artists, or time periods.
*   **Apple Music Integration:** Play using Apple Music.
*   **Flexible Gameplay Options:** Choose between your own printed cards or use the original Hitster card set.

## Creating Custom Datasets

TrackStar allows you to use custom song datasets. A Python script, `generate.py` in the `backend` directory, is provided to help you generate these datasets.
